# Timeline Kata

## Goal

The goal of this kata is to work on class invariant.
The 90's OOP promess was to let developper design real world objects and was all about class responsabilities.

While we know the limits of designing the world in a program, class responsability is still something that is to be desired.
The responsability is here declined in class invariants that the developper is asked to maintain carefully.

So, this kata will ask you to design a simple concept and make it more and more harder to do so.

## Timeline

A timeline is simple a bunch of ordered dates
